**iSAID Airplane Grayscale** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the aviation, security, and surveillance industries. The dataset presented here is produced from the original dataset. Learn more on the dataset's [homepage](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/romanrybalko/isaid-plane-gray).



The dataset consists of 270 images with 10214 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*airplane*).

Images in the iSAID Airplane Grayscale dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The original dataset was released in 2023 by the [Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, UAE](https://www.inceptioniai.org/en/contact-us), [Wuhan University, China](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), and [Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China](http://english.hust.edu.cn/).
